### 🔒 Security & Best Practices

## Get started

Follow these steps to get started with the template:

1. Click the **[Use this template](https://github.com/ccpu/electron-vite-tailwind-monorepo-template/generate)** button (you must be logged in) or clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ccpu/electron-vite-tailwind-monorepo-template.git
   cd electron-vite-tailwind-monorepo-template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash

   ```

That's all you need! 🎉

> [!TIP]
> You can explore the demo application for various frameworks and operating systems in the [Deployment](https://github.com/ccpu/electron-vite-tailwind-monorepo-template/deployments) section.
> This will allow you to see how the application performs across different environments.
> Additionally, you can verify the auto-update functionality by installing an outdated version of the application.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This project uses a **monorepo architecture** with **pnpm workspaces** and **Turbo** for efficient development and building. Each package is independent and can have its own tech stack, tests, dependencies, and frameworks.

### Package Details:

#### Core Application Packages:

- **[`app/main`](app/main)** - Electron [**main process**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-the-main-script-file) with TypeScript
- **[`app/preload`](app/preload)** - Electron [**preload scripts**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-preload) for secure IPC
- **[`app/renderer`](app/renderer)** - React frontend with Tailwind CSS, Vite, and modern tooling

#### Additional Packages:

- **[`packages/dev-mode`](packages/dev-mode)** - Development mode utilities
- **[`packages/electron-entry`](packages/electron-entry)** - Electron entry point
- **[`packages/electron-versions`](packages/electron-versions)** - Electron version management
- **[`packages/integrate-renderer`](packages/integrate-renderer)** - Renderer integration

#### Development Tools:

- **[`tooling/eslint`](tooling/eslint)** - Shared ESLint configurations for all packages
- **[`tooling/prettier`](tooling/prettier)** - Code formatting configurations
- **[`tooling/typescript`](tooling/typescript)** - TypeScript configurations for different package types
- **[`tooling/vitest`](tooling/vitest)** - Testing configurations and utilities

> [!NOTE]
> All internal packages are prefixed with `@app/*` or `@internal/*` for clear organization and to avoid naming conflicts with external dependencies.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 📦 Building for Production

When your application is ready for distribution, you can compile it into an executable using [electron-builder]:

- **Local build**: Run `pnpm run compile` to create a distributable application locally
- **Auto-updates**: For production releases with auto-update support, use the GitHub Actions workflow in [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)

> [!TIP]
> This template is configured to use GitHub Releases for distributing updates, but you can configure other distribution methods.
> See the [electron-builder documentation](https://www.electron.build/configuration/publish) for more options.

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing with Vitest

Each package can include unit tests using Vitest:

```bash
# Run tests for all packages
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test --watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test --coverage
```

#### End-to-End Testing with Playwright

E2E tests are located in the [`tests`](tests) directory and test the complete compiled application:

```bash
# Run E2E tests (requires compiled app)
pnpm run test:e2e
```

### 🔗 Working with Dependencies

#### Frontend Dependencies (Renderer)

The renderer package works like a regular React web application. You can use any browser-compatible dependencies:

- ✅ React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- ✅ Lodash, Axios, Date-fns
- ✅ UI libraries (Material-UI, Chakra UI, etc.)
- ✅ CSS frameworks (Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, etc.)

#### Node.js Dependencies (Main & Preload)

For Node.js APIs and system-level functionality, use dependencies in the main or preload packages:

- ✅ File system operations
- ✅ Database connections
- ✅ Native modules
- ✅ System information libraries

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Security Rule**: Never use Node.js APIs directly in the renderer. Always expose them through the preload script using `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld()`.

### 🌐 Environment Variables & Configuration

All environment variables are available through `import.meta.env` in Vite-powered packages:

```typescript
// Access environment variables
const isDev = import.meta.env.DEV;
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
```

#### Environment Files

Environment variables are loaded from these files (in order of priority):

```
.env                # Loaded in all environments
.env.local          # Loaded in all environments (gitignored)
.env.[mode]         # Loaded in specific mode only
.env.[mode].local   # Loaded in specific mode only (gitignored)
```

#### Mode Configuration

- **`development`** - Used by `pnpm start`
- **`production`** - Used by `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run compile`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the renderer process for security reasons.

Example `.env` file:

```bash
# ❌ Not exposed to renderer (server-side only)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp

# ✅ Exposed to renderer (prefixed with VITE_)
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

> [!TIP]
> Add TypeScript definitions for your environment variables in [`types/env.d.ts`](types/env.d.ts) for better IntelliSense.
